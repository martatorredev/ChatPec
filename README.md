# ChatPec - A sarcastic chatbot to raise awareness 💬

## Overview
**ChatPec** is a project developed in **React** in collaboration with **Agata Agency**, created with a clear goal: to raise awareness about the environmental impact of generative AIs.

Generative AIs are everywhere nowadays, but few people talk about their massive energy consumption. Many of these tools are used to solve problems that could easily be handled with simpler solutions... like a good old-fashioned search engine.

So we decided to create **ChatPec**, a simple chatbot — no fancy algorithms or complex logic — that responds exclusively with sarcasm. Because, let's be honest, sometimes sarcasm is the only way to get people’s attention.

## Why 'ChatPec'? 🤔
The name comes from "Por El Clima" (\"For The Climate\"), although... yeah, we know it can have other interpretations too xD.

## Project Goals
- Develop a lightweight chatbot using **React**.
- Raise environmental awareness through humor and sarcasm.
- Avoid the use of unnecessary infrastructures and excessive resources.

## Features
- 💬 **Sarcastic and ironic responses** to grab attention.
- ⚡ **Lightweight and efficient**, without draining excessive resources.
- 🌍 **Environmental awareness** delivered with humor as a tool.

## Technologies Used
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **CSS-in-JS** for styling
